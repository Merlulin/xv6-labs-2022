/**
 * Write a concurrent version of prime sieve using pipes.
 * Your goal is to use pipe and fork to set up the pipeline. 
 * The first process feeds the numbers 2 through 35 into the pipeline. 
 * For each prime number, you will arrange to create one process that reads from its left neighbor over a pipe and writes to its right neighbor over another pipe. 
 * Since xv6 has limited number of file descriptors and processes, the first process can stop at 35.
 * 
 * pseudocodeï¼š
 * p = get a number from left neighbor
 * print p
 * loop:
 *      n = get a number from left neighbor
 *      if (p does not divide n)
 *          send n to right neighbor
